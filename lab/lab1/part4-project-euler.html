    # Lab 1, Part 4 â€” Stretch Goal: Project Euler

    ## Introduction

    Practice your Javascript and math skills by solving a problem on Project
    Euler. Project Euler is a series of challenging math and computer science
    problems that can be solved using any language (for our class, use
    Javascript).

    Solve the first problem on this page https://projecteuler.net/archives
    (Multiples of 3 and 5). To check your answer, create an account and you will
    be able to submit your final result.

    If you complete problem 1, move on to problem 2!

    Start code

//Problem #1
//If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
//Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
//Worked with Ian Schwarzenberg
//Code support found via: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/77018/project-euler-1-javascript
var emptyArray = [];//creates an empty array
var answer = 0;//establishes sum variable for use in loop

for (var i = 1; x < 1000; x++) {//establishes look from 1 to 1000
    if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {//if statement selecting multimpes of 3 OR 5
        emptyArray.push(i);//loop to push variables that are multiple of 3 OR 5
        answer += i;//sums up the variables in the array (answer = answer + i)
    }
}
console.log(answer);//geneates answer of 233168

//Problem #2
//Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
//1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
//By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
//Code support found via: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39178973/project-euler-2-fibonacci-javascript-attemp

var fibonacci = [0,1];//Establishes 2 variable array with values of 0 and 1
var i = 0;//sets starting point of i to 0
var answer = 0;//establishes sum variable for use in loop
while (fibonacci[0]+fibonacci[1] < 4000000){//establises while loop for values up to 4,000,000
    i= fibonacci[0]+fibonacci[1];//sets loop to add the two previous variables
    fibonacci[0]=fibonacci[1];//establishes variable 0
    fibonacci[1]=i;//establishes variable 1
    if(i%2 === 0){//establishes if statement for remainder set to 0 for i=2*(i/2)
    answer += i;//then returns sums up the variables in the array (answer = answer + i)
    }
}
console.log(answer);//geneates answer of 4613732
